# Research JS Methods

### What are methods?
'Methods' are functions built into data types. They are pre-existing functions in JavaScript that enable developers to perform commonly needed functionality instead of writing code for that from scratch every time they want that functionality to exist. 

We've coded up a few examples of these to show you what they are and when they may be used: 

[object-methods](./object-methods.js)  
[array-methods](./array-methods.js)  
[string-methods](./string-methods.js)  
[math-methods](./math-methods.js)  

You can run these examples to see the results by running this command with the chosen filename when you are in this repo in the terminal:

```
  node filename
```

for example you might start with: 

```
  node object-methods
```

We'd like you to research `two` methods and provide a code example and explanation (for each one) of what that method does and could be used for. You can write your examples in the `my-examples.js` file.

We encourage you to find some methods on your own, though we have also included a list of some methods you could choose from. 
(This is not an extensive list of all methods!)


| Object Methods | Array Methods | String Methods | Math Methods | Global/Other Methods |  
|----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Object.values()| .split()      | .replace()     |  Math.min()  | typeof         |
|                | .map()        | .repeat()      |  Math.max()  | .parseInt()    |
|                | .find()       |                |              |  Date()        |
|                | .join()       |                |              | .eval()        |


To test the output of your functions you can copy the structure from the other examples Call the functions sections and then run: 
```
node my-examples.js
```
